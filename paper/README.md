# Code and resources to reproduce the results in the miR-MaGiC paper

## Raw sequencing data

Fastq files are available for download at https://phenogen.ucdenver.edu/.

## src/figures/

R scripts to produce the figures in the paper from the output of each quantification method

## src/functional_groups/

Script to create the functional groupings of miRNAs by parsing miRBase names. NOTE: some of the more obscure species in miRBase have a different name format for miRNAs. The regular expressions in the script define the names that can be collapsed by this script.
